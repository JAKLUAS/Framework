# Framework

Sprint via command line.
1. Sprint 1 Tasks:

2. Link to the AUT (application under test) - https://www.delta.com/

3. Research the AUT and understand its purpose and various functionalities.

4. Plan and decide on modules and functionalities that are going to be tested this Sprint.

5. Create a GitHub repository for the team and push the framework there and add team members as collaborators (done by Team Lead)

6. Create 25 functional test cases that cover the modules/functionalities of the AUT that are included in this Sprint. Test cases should be divided among team members equally and should not overlap.

7. Use Jira to track and manage the test cases completion and bug resolution.

8. Automate the test cases using the TestNG framework. It is strongly suggested that each team member create their own framework from scratch since it is an essential skill of an automation test engineer. However, only one person (team lead) should push his/her framework to GitHub and everyone should collaborate on that single project by pulling and pushing their work. The code collaboration on GitHub should be a branch-based workflow where each team member works in their individual branch and merges their changes through pull requests.

   Your framework:

9. Must be implemented using Page Object Model and Page Factory

10. Must use Singleton WebDriveroMust use properties file to store environment variables, properties, credentials, etc.

11. Must contain two TestNG xml files for smoke test suite and regression test suite

12. Must support running different xml files from the command line.
